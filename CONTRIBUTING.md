Contributing to Eclipse UML Profiles Repository
===============================================

Thanks for your interest in this project.

Project description:
--------------------

The modeling facilities of Eclipse are an essential part of Eclipse's annual release trains. The Eclipse Modeling Framework and associated projects, like UML2, OCL, QVTo etc., are integrated into several tools both commercial and open source. In particular the UML2 project is one of the most important implementation of the corresponding OMG UML 2.4 specification. Within the Eclipse MDT sub-project further standard implementations are either already available, such as the Object Constraint Language (OCL) or announced, such as the Semantic Business Vocabulary and Rules (SBVR) or the Business Process Management Notation (BPMN). However, there is no centralized repository to host standardized UML profiles yet. As a result, lots of different and sometimes incompatible implementations of prominent UML profiles have been developed for different Eclipse-based tooling landscapes
